# backcountry_ski_app

#Project Description
I was tasked with building a full stack server application. I chose to create an app centered around one of my passions - skiing. The goal of the app is to create a community as a resource for backcountry skiing. Users will post their favorite spots and educate others about the experience. I used mongoDB as my database and used mongoose as middleware. I also used express and handlebars.
